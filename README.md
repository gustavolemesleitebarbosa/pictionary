## For Real-time Multiplayer

**Important Note**: This current version includes the UI and game logic, but for full real-time multiplayer functionality, you'll need to connect to a backend service.

### Recommended: Supabase Integration

For real-time features like:
- Live drawing synchronization
- Real-time chat and guesses
- Room management
- Player state sync

I recommend connecting this project to Supabase for the backend functionality:

1. Click the green "Supabase" button in the Lovable interface
2. Connect to your Supabase project
3. This will enable real-time database features for multiplayer sync

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the root directory (when using Supabase):

```env
# Supabase Configuration (obtained from Supabase dashboard)
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

## Development Notes

- **Mobile-First Design** - Optimized for touch interactions
- **Cross-Browser Compatible** - Works on modern mobile browsers
- **Responsive Layout** - Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Performance Optimized** - Smooth drawing and real-time updates

## Technologies Used

- **React 18** - Frontend framework
- **TypeScript** - Type safety and better development experience
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **shadcn/ui** - Modern UI components
- **Lucide React** - Beautiful icons
- **Vite** - Fast development build tool
